<h1>Peace</h1>

Our app is designed to help domestic violence survivors.

The alpha version is here: https://phoenix-seven.vercel.app/

The front-end was built in Gatsby: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/ and can be run with `gatsby develop` from the root directory of this project after you clone it down.
The local Express server can be run simultaneously, but you will need your own Twilio credentials: https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/node

The Auth0 and PostgreSQL integration is not yet complete.
